# NodeSandbox

##### Random proof of concept, tutorial, and demo things.

### Getting Started

- clone repo
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `npm start`

### Build with Gulp

- `gulp build`

This will create a `build` folder containing a client and server folder.  The client javascript and css are consolidated and minified and ready to deploy.
